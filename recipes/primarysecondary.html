        <h1>Primary Secondary Systems</h1>

        <p><h3>System Description</h3></p>
        <p>The Primary/Secondary system has become the industry standard for new building installations, and it's no wonder. They may not be the most energy efficient (see <a href="../recipes/variableprimary.html">Variable Primary Systems</a>), but there are few system losses combined with a simple operation and an understand rugged reliability. As the name suggests, the system has two loops: the primary and the secondary. We will cover the primary first.</p>
        <p>The <strong>primary loop</strong> -- the bottom left of the above diagram -- circulates a constant flow of water through the chillers. This is acheived with constant speed pumps. Normally, you will see one pump paired with and sized for each chiller to ensure balancing. In fact, with a properly sized system, you won't need those shown green balancing valves at all. Also, that constant primary flow is important. Many chillers cannot handle a variable flow.</p>
        <p>The <strong>secondary loop</strong> is the rest of the picture. It takes a variable volume of water from the primary loop to supply flow to all of the users that you see scattered throughout the rest of the system. This variable flow allows a pump to move less than its design flow for the majority of its operation, reducing required pump horsepower and increasing energy efficiency. The pump speed is automatically controlled to increase or decrease automatically, as demands change. The specifics of the controls setup is outside the scope of this overview, or else I would be here all day. Three wives, remember?</p>
        <p>The astute reader will notice a potential discrepency. The primary loop has a constant flow, but the secondary pumps may flow less than that. Correct! This is balanced with a that very important, and often very short, piece of green pipe. It is called the <em>bridge</em>. Primary flow that does not go into the Secondary loop goes through the bridge. There is almost always flow through the bridge.</p>

        <p><h3>Advantages</h3></p>
        <P><em>(In no particular order)</em></P>
        <ul>
            <li>This setup is much easier to expand than other systems. This can greatly decrease follow-up capital expense and ensure that future expansion is even feasible.</li>
            <li>Reliability</li>
            <li>Well understood and does not need a <em>higher-than-expected</em> system understanding to operate</li>
            <li>Solid system efficiency</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Disadvantages</h3></p>
        <p><em>(Ordered by most critical to least)</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>This system costs more than the <a href="variableprimary.html">Variable Primary</a> System due to the additional pumps required.</li>
            <li>The system loses some operating efficiency due to the inability to vary flow through the chillers.</li>
            <li>With large secondary loops, the user closest to the secondary pumps may see high pressures, which can make balancing difficult. However, this is often understood and accounted for by the balancing contractor and design engineer.</li>
        </ol>
