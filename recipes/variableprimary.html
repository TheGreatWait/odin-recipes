        <h1>Variable Primary Systems</h1>

        <p><h3>System Description</h3></p>

        <p><em>It is recommended that you learn about the <a href="primarysecondary.html">Primary Secondary</a> system first before reading about this one. They share many of the same characteritics.</em></p>
        <p>From an equipment point of view, the <strong>Variable Primary</strong> system is the simplest of the three that we will look at today. It only consists of one main loop. The primary pumps provide a variable flow of water to the chillers. The chiller control valves modulate to control exactly how much water goes to which. While this is changing in the industry, most chillers do not support variable flow, so each control valve will either be completely open or completely closed.</p>
        <p>Cool water from the chillers now has two options: it can either keep flowing to the users, or it can bypass the users and head directly back to the primary pumps to be recirculated. The amount of water going each way is controlled by the <strong>bypass control valve</strong>, which is arguably the most critical part of this system. If it does not work correctly, the system will never be able to probide any meaningful cooling to users. It will either over-cool (using too much power) or under-cool, decreasing overall system performance.</p>
        <p>This delicate balance between 1) the number and speed of the primary pumps, 2) the number of chillers operating, 3) whether the chiller control valves are opened and closed, and 4) the bypass valve status, makes the variable primary the easy to learn / difficult to master system in the HVAC world.</p>

        <p><h3>Advantages</h3></p>
        <P><em>(In no particular order)</em></P>
        <ul>
            <li>This system is most efficient cooling hydronic setup possible without spending an arm and a leg on exotic chiller setups</li>
            <li>Because this system has so little equipment, it is relatively cheap to install</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Disadvantages</h3></p>
        <p><em>(Ordered by most critical to least)</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Variable Primary systems are simple from a layout view, but are operationally complex. Everything needs to work right for the system to function correctly.</li>
            <li>The system can be more expensive to expand than a <a href="primarysecondary.html">Primary Secondary</a> System. Booster pumps may be required for far-out users, which negates the benefits of this system in the first place.</li>
            <li>Control and equipment problems (which will develop as the system ages) can have a stark effect on system efficiency.</li>
            <li>Not all chillers can support variable flow, which constrains system operating flexibility.</li>
        </ol>
