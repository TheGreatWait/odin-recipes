        <p><h3>System Description</h3></p>
        <p><em>It is recommended that you learn about the <a href="primarysecondary.html">Primary Secondary</a> system first before reading about this one. They share many of the same characteritics.</em></p>

        <p>Primary Secondary Tertiary systems ar the more complicated big brother to well-understood Primary Secondary loop. Instead of the secondary loop supplying to individual users, it supplies to yet another loop. In the real world, this often translates to a central utility building providing chilled water to other buildings, which each have their own chilled water loop. Common applications are large office complexes, college campuses, or centralized municipal chilled water system.</p>

        <p>Obviously, this system is more complicated and costly than the other system looked at today, and should only be looked at for very large projects. In order to remove some of these costs, owners may be convinced to remove the tertiary pumps, and rely on the secondary pumps to destribute water to end users. While possible, it is much harder to ensure that this will always be the case. The end-of-the-line user may have worse performance for it, especially when system demands change quickly.</p>

        <p><h3>Advantages</h3></p>
        <P><em>(In no particular order)</em></P>
        <ul>
            <li>This setup is much easier to expand than other systems, even Primary Secondary's. These easily allow buildings to grow into campuses, as long as the initial design is right.</li>
            <li>The system is very flexible with demands. If one tertiary loop is not in use, the system can account for it efficienctly and with ease.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Disadvantages</h3></p>
        <p><em>(Ordered by most critical to least)</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>This system costs more than the <a href="variableprimary.html">Variable Primary</a> System due to the <em>many</em> additional pumps required.</li>
            <li>This system is the least efficient due to the number of operating pieces of equipment at any given time.</li>
            <li>As with Primary Secondary Systems, the user closest to the secondary pumps may see high pressures, but the user at the end of the loop may also see very low ones. If the supply pressure by the last user is lower than return, the end user can experience the dreaded <em>backwards bridge flow</em>, causing them to only have warm water for their users.</li>
        </ol>
