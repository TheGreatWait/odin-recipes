        <p>Hello. It is me, your host, the ghost of Willis Carrier. Just like my photo on this website, I was a larger than life figure in the HVAC industry. I started it, after all.</p>

        <p>Some others may be concerned with the unimportant parts of life, like dietary nutrition or a balanced diet. We, however, are focused on a higher task: designing balanced hydronic systems that reliably provide cooling with a low coefficient of performance.</p>

        <p>While I may be in Heaven, surrounded by my three wives -- monogamy is confusing in Heaven when you marry three times but never divorce -- I will teach you about some common chilled water systems. </p>

        <p>I will assume that you know the basics of how chillers and pumps operate. If you do not, <em>and you likely won't</em>, I apologize, but I don't have much free time. Three wives, after all.</p>
